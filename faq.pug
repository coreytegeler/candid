						.col-lg

							h4 What’s actually changing?
						.col-lg
							p As we begin this transition, all products and services will stay as is, without interruption. There will be a few changes to local office locations and operations in 2019 as we begin to focus our attention on Foundation Center’s vast network of Funding Information Network sites. These changes will allow us to serve local communities better than ever before. Other Candid-specific products and enhancements are on the way, but everything has been planned with an eye toward making the transition as smooth as possible.

							h4 Will there be any changes to my account?
						.col-lg
							p No, your account or subscription will not change. You will see some messaging about and from Candid, but your account will remain the same. If you have purchased a product, Candid’s name will be on your bill. But everything else is the same.

						.col-sm
							h4 I pay for Foundation Center and GuideStar services. Do I only need to subscribe to one now? 
						.col-lg
							p For now, you’ll have to subscribe to each service separately. We will begin exploring how this information can be combined and packaged for future product enhancements.

							h4 I’ve been corresponding with someone at GuideStar or Foundation Center. How do I reach them now?
						.col-lg
							p Our new email addresses follow this form—firstname.lastname@candid.org—but you can still reach us at our old email addresses and phone numbers, too.

							h4 What about your physical locations and offices? How about the Funding Information Network?
						.col-lg
							p Our offices will bring together staff in the Bay Area, DC, and New York. We’ll keep two main headquarters: in Williamsburg, VA (GuideStar’s former office) and New York City (Foundation Center’s former office). Foundation Center’s existing offices in Atlanta and Cleveland will be relocating to new spaces. At the same time, we are increasing our commitment to the Funding Information Network (FIN), a network of 400 library and nonprofit resource centers around the country and the world. Our field offices will shift from serving as libraries themselves to supporting FIN sites. This way, we will be able to provide more training and more localized access to all of Candid’s resources, anytime and anywhere.
